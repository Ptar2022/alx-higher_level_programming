The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3<br>
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository<br>
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory<br>

All your files must be executable<br>
The length of your files will be tested using wc<br>
Shell Scripts<br>
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs<br>
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS<br>
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)<br>
All your files should end with a new line<br>
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash<br>

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl<br>
You are not allowed to use global variables<br>
No more than 5 functions per file<br>
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples<br>
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h<br>
Don’t forget to push your header file<br>
All your header files should be include guarded<br>
